# LinkedIn Message Reply AI Chrome Extension

An AI-powered Chrome extension for LinkedIn that reads your previous chats, generates context-aware replies with descriptions, and automates the response process.

## Features

- **Context-Aware Replies:** Automatically reads previous LinkedIn chats and generates tailored responses based on your description and conversation history.
- **Customizable Descriptions:** Set a custom description to guide the AI in generating the reply.
- **Auto-Send Functionality:** Sends the generated reply automatically after a 10-second delay.
- **Manual Override:** Stop the auto-send feature by tagging in the text area, allowing you to edit or change the reply before sending.
- **Seamless Integration:** Uses the **Gemini API** for natural language processing and robust response generation.
